  Welcome to this guide for the Journaling Python Application.
  <br>
  If you did not download the application yet, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/Sraijer/Python_PO_2425">https://github.com/Sraijer/Python_PO_2425</a>
</p>
<h1>
  General user guide to the application
</h1>
  This Python Application is able to run on every application that support the latest version of python. Please make sure you have python installed. To do this, go to the official website and download python and make sure you have a code editor on your PC.
  <br>
  If you are using Thonny, please make sure to import all needed libraries in there aswell.
<h2>
  Different modules and libraries
</h2>
  For this Python Application you will need to install PILLOW. In case you do not have PILLOW pre-installed, see the command line for your terminal in the README file.
  <br>
  All other libraries that need import are in a line of code on the top. If you are experiencing any problems, please contact <a href="mailto:204369@stmichaelcollege.nl">204369@stmichaelcollege.nl</a>
<h1>
  Using the application
</h1>
  The application name is main_journal_app.py 
  <br>
  You can run this on your PC.
  <br>
  When you run the code in your editor, there will appear GUI screen. This is where majority of the code will be run and displayed.
  <br>
  You will see a welcome/homescreen with 4 buttons and an image.
<h2>
  The buttons
</h2>
  All buttons have different functions associated with them. You can press each of them. Please do not be alarmed if another window pops up.
  <br>
  To go back to the userguide, press "Userguide".
<h3>
  Generate Prompt
</h3>
  The top-most button is to generate a prompt. Pressing this button will open a "TopLevel" Window named "Random prompt".
  <br>
  Here you can press "new prompt" to display a prompt.
  <br>
  <p>Please note that pressing the button again will give another prompt. Pressing the button will not save the prompts previously displayed.</p>
  To display a new prompt, press the button again.
  <br>
  To exit this screen, click the "close" button, generally found in the top left corner.
  <p>this is not a button in the window, but rather in the window.</p>
<h3>
  Add Prompt
</h3>
  The second button is to add a new prompt to the database (DB). pressing this button will open a "TopLevel" window named "Entry window", with a message box and a "Publish" button.
  <h4>
    Publish
  </h4>
    The publish button will 'push' whatever is written in the message box to the DB.
    <p>Please note this is irriversible unless you delete the DB from your laptop
      <br>
      Do not be alarmed when you do delete the database. Running the code again will automatically make a database with 21 starting "basic" prompts.
    </p>
    After publishing, clear the message box if you want to add another prompt or close the window the same way you would the "Random prompt" window.
<h3>
  Userguide
</h3>
  This button will open this webpage in your browser.
<h3>

  Pressing this button will give a pop-up application. Please follow the instructions on screen.
  <h4>
    Yes
  </h4>
    Pressing "Yes" will close the window in 5 seconds. Please read the terminal in your code editor.
